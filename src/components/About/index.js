        Most of my career has been technical. Since my early childhood, I have always been passionate about technologies and computers. 
        I was the go-to among my family and friends for any computer-related problems. Even at a young age, 
        I was fascinated with programming. I even took some courses at school, but once it got a bit advanced I lost focus 
        and got discouraged. Later in life, new programming languages developed that were a bit easier to learn,
         and an online community was formed to help current and future programmers. This prompted me to revisit 
         programming so I took some courses online. After gaining some skills, I decided to future knowledge and enrolled into a Bootcamp. 
         It is challenging as there are lots of new technologies and concepts to learn, but it has made me a more confident and better programmer.
